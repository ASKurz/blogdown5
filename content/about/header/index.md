<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a full-time research psychologist, with a doctorate in clinical psychology from the [University of Mississippi](https://psychology.olemiss.edu/) in 2018. My main gig is as a researcher and statistics/methods consultant at the [VISN 17 Center of Excellence](https://www.mirecc.va.gov/visn17/). I also moonlight as a statistics instructor for doctoral students in behavior analysis at [The Chicago School of Professional Psychology](https://www.thechicagoschool.edu/learn/los-angeles/?utm_campus=105).

It's been a minute, but I'm also trained as a therapist. My primary therapeutic orientations are ACT and mindfulness-based interventions. I have had additional focused training in the areas of trauma and substance use.

I also spend a lot of time making tutorial material on applied statistics, particularly from with the R computing framework.
