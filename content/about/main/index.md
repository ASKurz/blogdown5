  Over the past year, I've been thinking a lot about how to analyze data from various research paradigms within the overall Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. It may seem disjointed, but you can find echos of that topic reverberating through many of my recent blog posts. I'm also starting to write a book on the topic, about which you can learn more [here](https://github.com/ASKurz/Experimental-design-and-the-GLMM).
