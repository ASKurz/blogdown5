# Books

At present, all of my books share a similar format and goal. I am a fan of applied Bayesian statistics. In recent years, scholars have released user-friendly Bayesian software packages and have published reasonably-accessible introductory books on applied Bayesian analysis. These have been boons for us all.

In my experience, Bayesian methods are easiest to use within the **R** computing environment by way of Paul BÃ¼rkner's [**brms** package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms). At present, very few textbooks showcase how to use **brms** for applied Bayesian data analysis. My books are an effort to fill that content gap and to make the powerful techniques afforded by the Bayesian paradigm even more accessible to applied researchers. In addition, I make heavy use of the collection of **R** packages known as the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) when manipulating and visualizing my data.

I make periodic updates to these books, which are reflected in their version numbers. These resources are now and will always be freely available to all. In all cases, however, these should be considered as supplements to the original source materials.

Here's the list:

### *Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis in brms and the tidyverse*, version 0.0.2

This is a translation of the examples and figures from Singer and Willett's classic *Applied longitudinal data analysis: Modeling change and event occurrence*. 
* You can find my ebook at https://bookdown.org/content/4253/
* You can find information about the original book by Singer and Willett [here](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195152968.001.0001/acprof-9780195152968).
* :warning: This project is in the very early stages. Beware of typos, mistakes, and other unsightly blemishes.

### *Doing Bayesian data analysis in brms and the tidyverse*, version 1.0.0
